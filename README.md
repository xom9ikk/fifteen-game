# For users ðŸ˜€
Fifteen is a game that was very popular in the `19th` and `20th` century. 
I recreated this game, but using a creative and simple design, so that nothing unnecessary distracts the player from the gameplay.

To start the game, simply **swipe** if you are playing on a mobile phone.
Or use the **arrows** to conveniently control from the keyboard.

When the game starts, a `timer` starts and you have a `counter` of your movements.
A **dark** theme is also available if needed.
